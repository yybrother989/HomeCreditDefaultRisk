    "## Background of Business situations\n",
    "- What does Home Credit Group do ?\n",
    " Home Credit is an internation non-bank financial services company that provides credit and loan products to consumers,especially to population with little or no enough qualified credit history.\n",
    "- How data generated from customers help Home Credit Group to provide its products and services ?\n",
    " Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n",
    "- Why predictions of customers' repayment ability are important for Home Credit ?\n",
    " As we mentioned, the most customers of Home Credit are people who have little or no enough qualified credit history and score, which means they were not qualified to get a loan/credit in traditional bank-format financial institutions. In the other words, this group of customers may be labelled high-rick in traditional bank-format financial institutions. Therefore, if Home Credit can predict customers' repayment ability upon their applications and make more proper decisions which can balance the business profits and potential customers' default risks.\n",

    "While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, Home Credit provide 70,000 dollars rewards on Kaggle Competition platform to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful. Meanwhile, Home Credit will also ensure that the customers who are not capable of repayment are not given loans. Statistical speaking, Home Credit is looking for the machine learning classification model that can detect the cases of false positive and false negative effectively. However, if financial industry businesses are sensitive to risks of bad debt, they may want to a machine learning classification model that can improve the detective ability of false negative cases."
